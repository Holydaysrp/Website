This project presents the design and implementation of a sensor-based monitoring system that integrates LabVIEW, HiveMQ MQTT, Raspberry Pi, Arduino, Cloudflare, and a React-based website. The system collects and processes sensor data, enabling real-time visualization and historical analysis. The project highlights seamless communication between hardware and cloud infrastructure, demonstrating robust functionality across LabVIEW and the web application. Cybersecurity considerations and future improvements are discussed.
